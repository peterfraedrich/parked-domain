  <p>I'm sorry, but the website you're trying to go to doesn't exist anymore.</p>
  <p>Do you want to know why?</p>
  <p>I do too. I used to be a part of the company until its CEO forced me out.</p>
  <p>I thought we were friends.</p>
  <p>I thought we worked well together and that I was respected.</p>
  <p>But you can never really know people, can you?</p>
  <p>He said I wasn't comitted.</p>
  <p>Ask my wife how many late nights I spent working on his product. Ask my childrne how much time I spend working to make his visions come true.</p>
  <p>I quit my comfortable, full-time job for this. I went way out on a limb for this, for him.</p>
  <p>And this is how I was repayed.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p>He threatened to sue me.</p>
  <p>He tried to hack into my accounts and steal these domains.</p>
  <p>He, who would simply not show up for meetings with potential investors.</p>
  <p>He, who would routinely miss meetings because he was hung over.</p>
  <p>He, who would snap back at clients and demand he was in the right.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p>Fuck him.</p>
