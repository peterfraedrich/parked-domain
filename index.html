  <p>I'm sorry, but the website you're trying to go to doesn't exist anymore.</p>
  <p>Do you want to know why?</p>
  <p>I do too. I used to be a part of the company until its CEO forced me out.</p>
  <p>I thought we were friends.</p>
  <p>I thought we worked well together and that I was respected.</p>
  <p>But you can never really know people, can you?</p>
